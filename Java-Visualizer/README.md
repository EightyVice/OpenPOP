Files for the Java-Version of OPT Visualizer 
============================================

These are files needed for the back and frontend of the Java version of Online Python Tutor. Also included, is a program used specifically for OpenDSA exercises that extracts crucial code from the input pane before the program visualization is activated. Once code is submitted on the frontend on a given pointers exercise on the OpenDSA frontend, the code will be sent to the backend. Files within the backendFiles directory will filter out the students code and return a visualization trace in a javaScript file. The contents of this file will then be sent back to the OpenDSA frontend to be displayed to the user. 

The frontend files were included here for examples of how to integrate them into the OpenDSA system.
