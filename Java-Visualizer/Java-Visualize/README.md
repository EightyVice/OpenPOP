java_visualize: visualization for java
David Pritchard (daveagp@gmail.com), created May 2013

This is the frontend for a Java visualizer. It is based on "Online Python Tutor",
a Python visualizer by Philip Guo.

You can grab the contents of this directory by following these directions


git clone --recursive https://github.com/daveagp/java_visualize

It's recursive because it includes two submodules. Because of this, 
to update, use the pair of commands
    git pull; git submodule update
