==================================================

// TODO: Update readme as directory contents are updated. 

jsonFilter contains files for removing an enormous amount of unwanted criteria from the generated backend json trace. 

JavaTraceGen contains the files from David Pritchard's daveagp/java_jail repository that were used to take in java code and produce a json object.
